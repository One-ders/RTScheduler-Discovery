This build directory is for the Blackpill stm32f411ce board.
The boards are available at ali express for under 10 usd.
See. https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F411CEU6-WeAct-Black-Pill-V2.0.html

I used dfu-util to flash it, f.ex.

dfu-util -a0 -s0x8000000:leave -DmyCore.bin


Else use st-link with the elf file myCore. But I could not get st-link
to communicate with the board.
